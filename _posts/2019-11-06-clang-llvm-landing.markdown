This series of tutorials will help you
  
  * Get familiar with the key concepts of clang/llvm

  * Write your own code analyzers

  * Build customized code translators

  * Debug your translators
  
  * Try out prebuilt clang/llvm-based tools

## Hands-on Learning
Give Clang/LLVM a try with the following tutorials:

[Clang -- An Introduction](/clang-intro) 
  * This is a short introduction on what is clang and how it can be used.

[Building OpenMP Support in LLVM](/llvm-openmp-build)
  * In this tutorial we cover how to build Clang/LLVM and enable OpenMP support in it.

[Clang -- Basics of compilation](/clang-basics)
  * This is a short introduction to the basics of compilation using Clang.

[ClangCheck -- Basics of AST error checking](/clang-check)
  * This is a short introduction to the basics of ClangCheck tool. 

[Libtooling -- a library to support writing standalone tools based on Clang](/libtooling)
  * This presents a basic walkthrough of how to write a tool using LibTooling.

[Clang -- Basics of AST manipulation](/clang-AST-basics)
  * This is a short introduction to the basics of Clang traversal.

[Adding a New Directive in OpenMP](/clang-new-directive)
  * In this tutorial we will cover how to add a token for a new OpenMP directive in Clang/LLVM compiler.

[Adding an AST Node for new Directive in OpenMP](/clang-ast-node)
  * In this tutorial we will cover how to add an AST Node for the new OpenMP directive in Clang/LLVM compiler.

[Identifying a Clause of new Directive in OpenMP](/clang-clause) 
  * In this tutorial we will cover how to identify and add a clause for the new OpenMP directive in Clang/LLVM compiler.

[Clang Plugin Example](/clang-plugin)
  * This is a tutorial about how to write a short plugin in Clang which modify the source code as required.

[Extracting OpenMP Information from Programs using a Clang Plugin](/openmp-extractor)
  * This is a clang plugin that can parse programs with OpenMP directives and generate Json files containing a description about loops.

[Getting Familar with LLVM IR](/llvm-ir)
  *  In this tutorial we will explain how to understand LLVM IR using a simplest C program as an example.

[Writing an LLVM Pass](/llvm-pass)
  *  In this tutorial we will cover how to construct a pass, everything from setting up the code, to compiling, loading, and executing it.
